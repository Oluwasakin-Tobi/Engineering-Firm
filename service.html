                                <h2>ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES <span class="featured"><span>CLEANUP / REMEDIATION </span></span></h2>
                                <p>
Offshore wind is a specialist environmental contracting service company, providing assistance to consultants and industry in the monitoring, management and remediation of contaminated land and water within the Niger Delta Areas and throughout Nigeria.

Offshore Wind International offers holistic solutions for the prevention, identification and cleanup of surface and subsurface pollution. This service includes the identification and quantification of possible pollution 
by means of an Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) and the actual management or remediation of the problem. The ESA is undertaken by the client's existing consultant, or can be provided in conjunction with one of the specialist consulting firms Offshore Wind works with.
</p>
<p>An Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) identifies the environmental liabilities through a series of investigations undertaken on the site to determine its present condition. Information generated through the Site Assessment process is used to design, test and apply a remediation solution that is most suited to the site conditions and client requirements.
The ESA is generally undertaken by consultant in order to identify the extent, nature and concentration of pollution. Offshore wind can base our solutions on existing assessments, or a turnkey solution can be provided in with conjunction with the consultant. The ESA will always form the first step. A solution can only be as good as the information it is based on and accurate and appropriate information is critical.
After the ESA, we will have a clear picture of the contamination problem and most efficient and cost effective way of reducing or removing the Contaminant of Concern. A variety of methodologies are available and constant research into new technologies is being undertaken. Every site is unique and only the most appropriate technology will be applied to each problem. Methods are decided upon through consideration of subsurface matrix, contaminant and cost implications.
</p>
<p>Methodologies can be classed into the following main groups:</p>

<p>1.   Physical contaminant and matrix removal</p>
<p>2.   Pump &Treat and Vacuum Enhanced Recovery</p>
<p>3.   Surface and ex situ methods, e.g. land farming, bio piles</p>
<p>4.   Soil Vapour Extraction (SVE) and Sparging</p>
<p>5.   Enhanced Bioremediation</p>
<p>6.   Intrinsic Bioremediation through Monitored Natural Attenuation.</p>
<p>7.   Chemical Remediation</p>

                            <h2>ENHANCED <span class="featured"><span>BIOREMEDIATION</span></span></h2>
                                <p>
Naturally occurring organisms in soil and groundwater break down a large range of organic contaminants. Through enhanced bioremediation these organisms are provided with an environment where they can grow and break down contaminants at a higher rate. This is done by the addition of oxygen (either through sparging or oxygen releasing compounds) and nutrients. A variety of other environmental factors may be manipulated to enhance the natural processes breaking down pollutants.
Offshore wind has undertaken several bioremediation projects, treating up to 1000 cubic meters of hydrocarbon contaminated soil at a time. Bioremediation can be undertaken in situ or ex situ depending on site conditions and client requirements. Our Microbiologists determine the required amendments and are able to monitor biological action throughout the project, providing feedback on any further amendments or treatment that will be required. Amendments used include microbial and enzyme additives, nutrients, stimulants and oxygen releasing compounds.
</p>

<h2>CHEMICAL <span class="featured"><span>REMEDIATION</span></span></h2>
                                <p>
Chemical remediation involves the injection of specific chemical compounds to break down or neutralize contaminants. A wide variety of processes and reactions are available, depending on contaminant chemistry and receiving environment. These may include: Oxidation / Reduction, Neutralization, Stabilization, Solidification or Mobilization.</p>

<h2>MONITORED <span class="featured"><span>NATURAL ATTENUATION</span></span></h2>
                                <p>
A risk based approach may determine that no specific action should be taken. This is often the case where the contaminants can be broken down through natural processes and no significant environmental or health risk exists. Contaminant concentrations are then simply monitored regularly to ensure that natural attenuation is taking place. This option is re-evaluated on a constant basis and further action is taken if the monitoring results are not satisfactory.</p>

                                <p>
Offshore wind personnel’s are able to undertake environmental drilling and sampling work for any type or scale of project.
We make use of a variety of Augering and Percussion drilling techniques to provide the required wells for monitoring and remediation purposes. Well construction and development can be done to any required specifications, depending on the geology and contaminant to be sampled or remediated.
We can provide advice to clients or consultants on appropriate drilling and well installation techniques that will fulfil their site specific requirements.
Offshore wind operates a 150mm hydraulic auger rig that can be used for soils sampling or monitoring well installation to a depth of 6m.

<h2>UTILITY <span class="featured"><span>DETECTION</span></span></h2>
                                <p>
Offshore wind can undertake service detection surveys for a wide variety of services and buried infrastructure. Our equipment can detect electrical cables to a depth of approximately 4.6m or deeper depending on the site material. Most metallic pipework can be detected to depths of up to 2m. For site specific applications, tracers and signal generators could be used to track a variety of underground services with great accuracy.
For more detailed detection of services and subsurface features we make use of a variety of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), Geophysical methods including electrical resistivity, magnetometers and Mag/VLF instruments.
We can provide detection services throughout Nigeria for projects ranging from small construction or building sites through to large linear developments such as roads, power or pipelines
